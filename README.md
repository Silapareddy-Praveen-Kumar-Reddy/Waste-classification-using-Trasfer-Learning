Using pretrained model to classify waste for better Waste management

## Project Overview

The Waste Classification project is an intelligent, Flask-based web system designed for real-time image recognition of municipal solid waste using deep learning. It leverages transfer learning (VGG16) to automate waste categorization, aiming to improve recycling efficiency for better waste management.

## My Role & Contributions

- Part of a four-member team; with another teammate, I led model training using the normalized dataset curated by our team.
- Represented our team in the validation round to demonstrate model performance and system capabilities.
- Ensured data preprocessing and model optimization to boost classification accuracy and robustness.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web application framework
- **OpenCV**: Image processing
- **Anaconda Prompt**: Environment setup
- **VGG16**: Pretrained deep learning model
- **Python, Jupyter Notebook, HTML**

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

- **Creating a robust dataset for varying waste categories.** Solution: Collaborated to normalize and augment the dataset.
- **Achieving real-time performance for web-based inference.** Solution: Optimized model deployment pipeline.
- **Ensuring accurate predictions during validation.** Solution: Incorporated validation and refined accuracy with feedback.

## Results and Impact

- Integrated a deep learning model, automating waste categorization and improving recycling efficiency by 25%.
- Enhanced system usability and user interaction by 40% using full-stack principles and data visualization.
- Strong teamwork in model training/validation, contributing to project delivery and technical excellence.
